            Hello! I'm James-Lee. I work at the movie theater in East Appleton (Marcus Valley Grand) and if you read my nametag there it'd say my favorite movie is Moana, but really I just couldn't think of any good movies when I had to pick for it. I spend (too) much of my time playing video games, and I hope to make video games one day. For now, I just try to enjoy my day with the people who are in it; I'm always happy to talk.
